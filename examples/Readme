This directory contains several example and test data sets that can be used to learn how to run the program package hypoDD.

The examples include the following data sets:

         # of events   catalogP  catalogS  crosscorrP  crosscorrS
example1      16          x          x          x           x       Hayward
example2     308          x          x          x           x       Calaveras 
example3  ~10000          x          x                              LongValley
test1      12292     	  x          x   			    San Andreas
test2       1014     	  x          x   			    San Andreas
test3       8281     	  x          x   			    Hawaii 

test1-3 are provided by Fred Klein. 

Because of the size of example3 and test1-3, these files come in a different package named HYPODD_moreExamples.tar.gz.

See Readme files in each directory on how to re-run the data sets.

The program results should not depend on the various array dimensions.
The program will run if the arrays are large enough, or fail if they
are not.  The "example" and "test" files were run with these sizes
(which may be larger than needed for some problems).  These are the
default dimensions in the standard file hypoDD.inc:

c parameters for medium size problems (e.g. : SUN ULTRA-2, 768 MB RAM)
       parameter(MAXEVE=  13000,    
     &          MAXDATA=  1300000,
     &          MAXEVE0=  30,
     &          MAXDATA0= 5000,
     &          MAXLAY=   12,
     &          MAXSTA=   2000,
     &          MAXCL=    50)

Note that if the arrays are not dimensioned large enough, hypoDD will
report an error stating the parameter to increase, and stop.
